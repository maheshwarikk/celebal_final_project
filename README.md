# 🚀 Delta Lake Change Data Capture (CDC) Pipeline – Databricks

This project focuses on implementing **Change Data Capture (CDC)** using **Databricks**, a unified data analytics platform built on Apache Spark. The primary objective is to **efficiently detect and process data changes**—including **inserts, updates, and deletes**—and reflect them in a **Delta Lake** target in **near real-time**.

The pipeline leverages **Delta Lake**, **Apache Spark**, and optional **streaming capabilities** to support **incremental ingestion**, ensure **data consistency**, and minimize **processing overhead**—resulting in a **scalable**, **reliable**, and **auditable CDC solution**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Identify and process **inserts, updates, and deletes** in source data
* ✅ Ingest only **changed data** into a **Delta Lake** table
* ✅ Maintain **data versioning and history**
* ✅ Ensure **atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID)**
* ✅ Enable **near real-time updates** with **auto-scheduling or streaming**
* ✅ Provide **email notifications** after each pipeline execution

---

## 🔧 Features

* 🔹 Generate realistic test data using `Faker` (Name, Address, Email)
* 🔹 Append data to Delta tables using the **Delta Lake API**
* 🔹 Use **MERGE INTO** operations for UPSERT logic (insert/update detection)
* 🔹 Implement soft or hard **delete** handling
* 🔹 Maintain a CDC audit trail with Delta’s **time travel & history**
* 🔹 Auto-schedule pipeline every 5 minutes using **Databricks Jobs**
* 🔹 Send HTML-formatted **email summaries** after data ingestion

| `table_summary.html`          | Sample HTML template for email summary    |

---

## ⏱️ Scheduling

The pipeline is set to run **every 5 minutes** using a **Databricks Job** and **CRON expression**, simulating continuous ingestion for near real-time CDC.

---

## ✉️ Email Notification

After each pipeline run, an **HTML email** is sent showing the **last 5 ingested records**, making it easy to monitor changes.

## 🔄 Planned Enhancements

* 🔄 Add full **`MERGE INTO`** logic for updates using a unique business key
* 🧹 Handle **soft/hard deletes** using status flags or tombstone records
* 📥 Use **Structured Streaming or Auto Loader** for real-time ingestion
* 🔑 Include **surrogate keys** for more reliable joins
* 🛡 Improve **data quality, deduplication, and conflict resolution**

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. ✅ Generate synthetic data with `Faker`
2. ✅ Append to Delta Table with `Inserted_Timestamp`
3. ✅ Use `DeltaTable.history()` and versioning for audit
4. ✅ Schedule with CRON every 5 mins
5. ✅ Send HTML email summary after each run
6. ⏳ (Planned) Implement `MERGE INTO` for UPSERT support
7. ⏳ (Planned) Detect and remove deleted records

---

## 📁 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo or import the notebook into Databricks
2. Set your SMTP config in the notebook (use Gmail App Password)
3. Schedule the notebook using a Databricks Job (every 5 mins)
4. Monitor the Delta table, email inbox, and version history

---

## 🏁 Final Notes

This project lays the foundation for a **production-grade CDC pipeline** using Delta Lake on Databricks. It is easily extensible to support full UPSERT logic, delete handling, and real-time streaming from sources like Kafka or cloud storage.
